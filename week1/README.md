# Week 1 – Introduction to UNIX, Shell scripting, and LaTeX

## README.md File Introduction and Explanation
Before moving into the main course content, I would like to briefly introduce the README.md file. This file includes the whole course structure and learning purpose of each week, also contains what we did and the understanding of what we did, which is the most important part in this document. 

This README.md file is only for week1 learning and it is inside the week1 folder. In addition, each week will have its own README.md file, which can be easily found in each week’s folder, introducing that week's modules (e.g., Shell Scripting, Git, Python, R). Alongside these weekly files, there is an overarching README.md file within the course's main directory (CMEECourseWork/), which summarises the whole course structure and main learning objectives.

## Week 1 Overview and Purpose
Week 1 indicates the introduction of **UNIX operation system**, **Linux commands**, **Shell scripting**, **Git version control**, and **LaTeX**, which are foundational computational tools used throughout the CMEE course. The main goal for this week is to gain familiarity with these tools. In addition, these knowledge could  provide a strong foundation for our future learning, enabling faster progress in Python and R.
