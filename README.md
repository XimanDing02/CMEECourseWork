# My CMEE Coursework Repository 
This repository contains all CMEECourseWork and weekly practices for the Living Planet with Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE) module.

Each weekly folder includes its own `README.md` file, describing that week’s objectives, scripts, and key learning outcomes.

Each weekly folder is organised into:

`code/` – scripts for practical exercises


`data/` – datasets used in the week


`results/` – outputs generated by scripts (ignored by Git when needed)


## Week 1: UNIX, Shell Scripting, Git and LaTeX

1. UNIX/Linux command line basics
2. Shell scripting and automation
3. Version control using Git and GitHub
4. Basic LaTeX document preparation


## Week 2: Biological Computing in Python
Focus on:
1. Basic Python syntax and variables
2. Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
3. Control flow and functions
4. File input/output
5. Simple sequence analysis and classification tasks

## Week 3: Biological Computing in R
Focus on:
1. R programming fundamentals
2. Control flow and conditionals
