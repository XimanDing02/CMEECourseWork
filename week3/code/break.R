# Initialize the counter variable
i <- 0

# Start an infinite while loop
while (i < Inf) {

  # Check whether i has reached 10
  if (i == 10) {

    # Break out of the loop when i equals 10
    break

  } else {

    # Print the current value of i
    cat("i equals", i, "\n")

    # Update i by increasing its value by 1
    i <- i + 1
  }
}
