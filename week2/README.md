# Week 2 â€“ Biological Computing in Python
In this week, we fucusing on Python progeamming skill. The overall learning process is from simple to complex, so it is quite comfortable for us to learn. Topics Contains such as data structure, control flow, loops, modular programming and so on. 

## Assessment 2
### Loops and List Comprehensions
1. lc1.py 

This task is to practice using loops to generate lists and process data iteratively. Understanding the uses of for and while loop to produce or transforming lists. 

foo_5(x) and foo_6(x) can not handle the siuation when x = 0, so I need to modify functions to fix this situation. I add the x == 0 in side the loop.

2. lc2.py 

This task is little bit more complicated than the code inside lc1.py. Let us to handle 2D lists, filter or transform multi-dimensional data.

3. dictionary.py 

This task showed me the Python dictionary structure. Inside this tasks, I created, updated, and deleted dictionary entries, iterating through keys and values, and demonstrating dictionary comprehension.

4. tuple.py

This task taught me about the structure about tuples as immutable ordered data collections and their practical applications in Python.

### Writing a program with control flows
I copy the lc1.py file to control_flow_lc1.py to practice structuring Python programs using control flows. I learned how to take user-provided arguments instead of hardcoded valuesuse, and combine with the conditional statements (like if, elif, else), loops, and return values to control program outputs. 

### Align DAN sequences
This task worked with DNA sequences and aligning them programmatically. I handled string data in Python, which including reading sequence data, comparing sequences, and finding the best alignment by minimizing mismatches.

### Missing oaks problem
In this task, I analysed a dataset to identify the missing entries related to the oak. The focus was on working with data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and sets, and using conditionals and loops to filter and extract information efficiently.
